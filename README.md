# homelight
Homelight is a better interface for interior lighting. 
* It has an dead simple interface that predicts what you want to use the lighting to do. 
* It adjusts the light color temperature based on the time of day and season to make you feel better. 
* It protects your home when it notices you're away. 
* It responds appropriately to sound and motion around the house. 
* It notifies you when you have a calendar event, or when there's a Duke Alert.
* It interfaces with Philips Hue and with my RGB LED accent strip lighting wireless controller.
